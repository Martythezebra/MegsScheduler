# MegsScheduler
This is a prototype casting tool for Meg, to be written in Python for the frontend and Prolog for the backend.

#Front - Python
A config file editing window will display a series of CastMember boxes. Each box will have a series of checkboxes and drop down lists. 
There is a check box for each cast role, with roles the CastMember is capable of performing checked off (Marty: Check Lights, Rocky; Jacob: Check Lights, Scott, Eddie)
The drop downs are for Compatible and Incompatible relationships. The default relationship between two people is neither, unspecified. Two people who cast well together (Marty, Meg) can be designated compatible, and two people who cast poorly can be designated as incompatible (Marty, Mollie). Relationships will be taken into account in terms of what schedule autocomplete options are preferred.
